    # Set this option if you want the action to check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec.
    check-latest: # optional
    # Optional registry to set up for auth. Will set the registry in a project level .npmrc and .yarnrc file, and set up auth to read in from env.NODE_AUTH_TOKEN.
    registry-url: # optional
    # Optional scope for authenticating against scoped registries. Will fall back to the repository owner when using the GitHub Packages registry (https://npm.pkg.github.com/).
    scope: # optional
    # Used to pull node distributions from node-versions. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting.
    token: # optional, default is ${{ github.server_url == 'https://github.com' && github.token || '' }}
    # Used to specify a package manager for caching in the default directory. Supported values: npm, yarn, pnpm.
    cache: # optional
    # Set to false to disable automatic caching based on the package manager field in package.json. By default, caching is enabled if the package manager field is present.
    package-manager-cache: # optional, default is true
    # Used to specify the path to a dependency file: package-lock.json, yarn.lock, etc. Supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.

    # The desired behavior if no files are found using the provided path.
Available Options:
  warn: Output a warning but do not fail the action
  error: Fail the action with an error message
  ignore: Do not output any warnings or errors, the action does not fail

    if-no-files-found: # optional, default is warn
    # Duration after which artifact will expire in days. 0 means using default retention.
Minimum 1 day. Maximum 90 days unless changed from the repository settings page.

    retention-days: # optional
    # The level of compression for Zlib to be applied to the artifact archive. The value can range from 0 to 9: - 0: No compression - 1: Best speed - 6: Default compression (same as GNU Gzip) - 9: Best compression Higher levels will result in better compression, but will take longer to complete. For large files that are not easily compressed, a value of 0 is recommended for significantly faster uploads.

    compression-level: # optional, default is 6
    # If true, an artifact with a matching name will be deleted before a new one is uploaded. If false, the action will fail if an artifact for the given name already exists. Does not fail if the artifact does not exist.

    overwrite: # optional, default is false
    # If true, hidden files will be included in the artifact. If false, hidden files will be excluded from the artifact.
